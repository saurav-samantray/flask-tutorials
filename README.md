## What is flask?
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.[3] It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself.
